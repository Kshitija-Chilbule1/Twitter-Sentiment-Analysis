# NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on thousands of Twitter tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. By converting textual data into numerical representations, we aim to train a model that can automatically classify tweets as positive or negative. This automated approach helps eliminate the need for manual review of vast amounts of social media data, enabling businesses to understand customer emotions and make data-driven decisions efficiently.
